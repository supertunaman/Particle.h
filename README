A particle system library for Arduino that can (theoretically) be used 
with any graphic LCD. Comes with an example that uses the ST7565 
available from adafruit.com

This code is inspired in part by the particle system described in 
Programming Linux Games by John Hall of Loki Software (RIP 1998-2002).
