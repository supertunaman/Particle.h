TODO for Particle.h
===================

 * AVR-GCC port
 * Gravity
    - four directions; up, down, left, right
    - varying strength levels
 * Directional explosions 
 * Wall collision detection
 * keywords.txt

Ideas:
 * Colored explosion support
    - Pretty gradients, etc
    - Who's willing to buy me a color GLCD to play with?
 * Auto-setting MAX_PARTICLES based on what AVR it's being compiled for
